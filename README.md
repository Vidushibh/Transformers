In this notebook, I have explored various modules in the transformers library to demonstrate the capabilities of NLP applications. By utilizing different pipelines and pre-trained models, 

I have covered the following tasks:

Sentiment Analysis: Implemented a pipeline for sentiment analysis to determine the sentiment of a given text.


Question Answering: Utilized BertForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad') to perform extractive question answering, providing precise answers to specific questions based on a given context.


Text Generation: Leveraged the gpt2 model for text generation, showcasing the ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a provided prompt.


Translation: Implemented a pipeline for English to French translation to demonstrate language translation capabilities.


Summarization: Used a summarization pipeline to condense long pieces of text into concise summaries.


To further enhance the user experience and visualize the potential of these NLP applications, I created an interactive interface using Streamlit. This interface allows users to easily interact with the various NLP tasks and see the results in a user-friendly manner.
